# CryptoListen

This Repository is for the development of CryptoListen, my dissertation project.

This project aims to evaluate the feasiblility of cryptocurrency mining in the browser as a web monetisation mechanism. It does this by simulating a music streaming websitre where a user is able to use the cryptocurrency mining feature in the background.
